<h1 class="mat-h1">Overview</h1>

Your code must be in the following syntax in order to work:

<pre><code>function yourScript() {{ '{' }}
	
	// your logic goes here...

	return 'guess';  // string value of what your guess is
{{ '}' }}
</code></pre>

<p class="mat-body">Keep all code in a <b>single function</b> (inner functions are allowed).</p>

<p class="mat-body">If your code returns an invalid guess (like a code that doesn't exist, or that has already been guessed) it will end the game.</p>

<p class="mat-body">You have access to the <code>this</code> variable to save state between guesses if you wish, as well as access to game state.</p>

<p class="mat-body">Logging is available through <code>console.log(message)</code>. You can also use <code>console.error(message)</code>, <code>console.warn(message)</code>, and console.debug(message).</p>

<p class="mat-body">All built-in game state variables are backed up prior to, and restored after, your function runs. This prevents tampering.</p>

<h2>"Likeness"</h2>

<p class="mat-body">A word's likeness is determined by whether or not the string's individual character values of the word match with the answer word's values in both index of the string, and in character value.</p>

<p class="mat-body">e.g. If "ghost" is the answer, and you guess "ghast", the likeness would be 4. However, if you guessed "roast", the likeness would only be 2, as only "s" and "t" would match in both index and value.</p>

The array of codes returned from this function are <b>not</b> string values, they are objects with three fields on them, <code>code</code>, <code>isGuessed</code>, and <code>likeness</code>. The <code>code</code> field on each object tells you the actual string value, the <code>isGuessed</code> field tells you whether or not you have guessed that code yet, and finally the <code>likeness</code> field tells you the likeness to the answer (a <code>-1</code> means it hasn't been guessed yet, so there isn't a likeness assigned).</td></tr>
